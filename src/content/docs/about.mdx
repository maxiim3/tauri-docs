:::caution[Prerelease Software]

This documentation is for the prereleased version of Tauri 2.0 and is subject to change as development continues. If you're looking for Tauri 1.0 documentation visit https://tauri.app.

:::

Tauri is a open source, cross-platform app toolkit used to create desktop and mobile apps. The core is built with the performance and security of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and the flexibility of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This means Tauri apps can be more secure, performant, and optimized by default while supporting [virtually any frontend framework](/guides/frontend/).

Reach out to the Tauri community [on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/tauri) for any help and read the [contributing guide](/contribute) if you're interested in getting involved!

## Get Involved

Tauri is open source and powered by and welcomes contributions of all kinds! Visit the [Contributing guide](/contribute) to learn how to get involved.

## Governance

One of the main goals of the organizational structure of Tauri is to guarantee we stay true to our open source values and do so sustainably while respecting the health and well-being of contributors. The [Tauri Programme within the Commons Conservancy](https://dracc.commonsconservancy.org/0035/) was established to commit to those values, and facilitate an open, transparent and efficient governance process throughout the future development of the Tauri and its auxiliary materials.

Learn more about Tauri's governance and structure in the [Governance and Guidance repo on GitHub](https://github.com/tauri-apps/governance-and-guidance).

## Trademark

While the Tauri software is available under a free and open source software license, that copyright license does not include a license to use the Tauri trademark. Read the [Trademark Guidelines](/trademark) to understand how to use the Tauri marks consistent with background law and community expectation.
