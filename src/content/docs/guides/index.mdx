## Why Tauri?

Tauri has 3 main advantages for developers to build on: a secure foundation for building apps, naturally smaller bundle size by using the system's native webview, and flexibility for developers to use any frontend and bindings for multiple languages.

### Secure Foundation

By being built on Rust, Tauri is able to take advantage of the memory, thread, and type-safety offered by Rust. Apps built on Tauri can automatically get those benefits even without needing to be developed by Rust experts.

Tauri also undergoes a security audit for major and minor releases. This not only covers code in the Tauri organization, but also for upstream dependencies that Tauri relies on. Of course this doesn't mitigate all risks, but it provides a solid foundation for developers to build on top of.

Read the [Tauri security policy](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/policy) and the [Tauri 1.0 audit report](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/audits/Radically_Open_Security-v1-report.pdf).

### Smaller App Size

Tauri apps take advantage of the web view already available on every user's system. A Tauri app only contains the code and assets specific for that app and doesn't need to bundle a browser engine with every app. This means that a minimal Tauri app can be less than 600KB in size.

Learn more about creating optimized apps in the [App Size concept](/concepts/size).

### Flexible Architecture

Since Tauri uses web technologies that means that virtually any frontend framework is compatible with Tauri. The [Frontend Configuration guide](/guides/frontend/) contains common configurations for popular frontend frameworks and the [Rendering concept](/concepts/rendering) discusses which rendering techniques work best with Tauri (such as SPAs and SSGs).

Bindings between JavaScript and Rust are available to developers using the `invoke` function in JavaScript and Swift and Kotlin bindings are available for [Tauri Plugins](/guides/plugins/).

[TAO](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao) is responsible for Tauri window creation and [WRY](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry) is responsible for web view rendering. These are libraries maintained by Tauri and can be consumed directly if deeper system integration is required outside of what Tauri exposes.

In addition, Tauri maintains a number of plugins to extend what core Tauri exposes. You can find those plugins alongside those provided by the community in the [Features and Recipes section](/features).
